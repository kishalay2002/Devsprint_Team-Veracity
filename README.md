**Problem Statement :**

Verifying the authenticity of products by enabling consumers to make a more informed decision regarding their purchases using the power of ethereum blockchain.

**Approach :**

We have chosen to resolve the issue using ethereum enabled smart contracts. The buyer gets to readily access the details of the product he/she is intending on buying enabling the person to make a more informed decision along with other details about the reliability of the seller. 

**Execution :**

Packages to install : pip install web3, pip install getpass
To run the program, use app3.py.

**Execution :**

Packages to install : pip install web3, pip install getpass
To run the program, use app3.py. 


**Functioning :**

app3.py : Creates an executable file
test.sol : Smart Contract written in Solidity using Web3 Technology. Contains the main instructions for the application. 
ipfsLinkGenereator.py : Uploads details of the Product to IPFS using Moralis API


**Workaround:**

For the purpose of this application, the token ID should be enetered in sequence. 0 for first token, 1 for second, etc.
It is using a zero-based indexing.
